# TrackMate-Oneat

TrackMate extension for oneat for verifying lineage trees

## Overview

Oneat is a keras based action classification library written by us and TrackMate-oneat is its Fiji extension that uses the results of detection of such cell events to correct lineage trees in TrackMate.

## Computational Support

Auto Track Correction using TrackMate-Oneat was granted access to the HPC resources of IDRIS under the allocation 2022 - [AD011013724], 2023 - [AD011013724R1] made by GENCI. We used the resources to create training data and inference on the imaging datasets.
